That are dumps from a HX850i. I'm pretty sure the 2022/2023 generation PSUs introduce
at least one new command.

userspace tool:
- rmi-hxi-query (done)
  Is a tool for querying the micro-controller of the HXi/RMi series, which
  basically works like the driver. But it runs in userspace, uses the hidapi lib
  and does not need the driver at all.

corsair-psu driver: (the one that got mainlined)
  I will add fan-control. The PSU can do two modes, automatic (with some saved plan
  with trigger levels) and manual mode. This can be mapped to 3 of the 4 (?) modes
  supported by the hwmon subsystem. It will be possible to add full automatic mode,
  manual mode (percentage setable between about 27% and 100% duty) and full on mode.
  It will not be possible to change the plans being part of the automatic mode. I
  do not fully know how these plans are set up. And to be honest, it would be a nice
  way to damage your hardware. The manual mode does not accept to low duty cycles
  (below about 27%) and are refused by the micro-controller. After quite some testing
  with a HX850i and a HX1500i I am sure this is save to add. The driver is already
  prepared for this, just the logic behind writing the fan mode to the PSU is
  missing.

enhanced corsair-psu driver: (partly done)
  It is the same driver as the mainline driver but with enhanced functionality,
  which is discouraged in kernel space. It supports calculating input current
  (just a proof of concept - actually a wild guess based on efficiency curves
  from the PSU manuals) and reporting over-current-protection status (will make
  it switchable in debugfs). Fan control will be added, too. Add collecting of
  statistical data (at least per session) which is actually supported by the
  hwmon subsystem.

Get support up for the AXi series:
  1B1C 1C00 Controller for Corsair Link            AX760i, AX860i, AX1200i
  1B1C 1C01 ?
  1B1C 1C02 Corsair AX1500i
  1B1C 1C11 Corsair AX1600i

  The USB dongles for the AXi series actually use a plain cp210x usb-serial bridge
  but only connectable to the AXi series PSUs by a propreitary connector. The
  first USB ID is already part of the cp210x driver. There are two possible ways
  to go to get this driver done. Writing a driver attaching to tty subsystem and
  these USB ids or replicate some functionality of the cp210x driver and add the
  hwmon stuff.

WARNING:
The information/code in these drivers and tools can be used to poke the
micro-controller. Don't poke around if you don't know what you are doing and
especially not if you have no access to Windows and the original software of
Corsair. By poking it is possible to mess up the plan which controls the automatic
fan control mode and I have not found a way yet to reset this plan back to the
default plan without using the original Windows software.
